My design of tis simulation goes from the ground up. I from the Strategy interface, to the Horse, to the Race,a nd finally calling everything from the Main class. The most important aspect of this simulation is the strategies themselves - how the horses behave. The rest are just layers of objects. I set aside all the math in my interfaces. I abstract other heavy computation and logic as well, so that when I reach my Race class, things get a bit easier when calling my horses to move. One thing I realize about designing before coding is that sometimes our end result might not match our design 100%. For instance, I ended up not dividing my Race class into 4 different functions. Instead. I only have one function call runRace() which simulates the entire race. I also did not end up having an addition distance (`dist`) variable in my Race class.
